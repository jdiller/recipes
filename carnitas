A pork roast (cut doesn't really matter, though I like boneless ones for simplicity)
2 cartons of chicken broth (low/reduced sodium is my fave, regular == really salty meat, no salt added == bland)
2 or 3 onions chopped into big chunks (8ths or so)
1 tbsp cumin
1 tbsp coriander
4 or 5 cloves garlic, chopped
some cayenne if you like a bit of heat
jalapenos (pickled work well), 6 or 7 slices usually do the trick, but you can adjust to taste

Cut up the pork into cubes/chunks. I try to get pieces about 3"x3"x3" or so, but precision isn't really required.
Throw everything in a pot, The meat should all be submerged in broth. If it's a bit below you can add some water.
Get it boiling then reduce it to an "energetic simmer"
Leave it alone, simmering uncovered for about 2.5-3 hours. There shouldn't be much/any visible liquid, but it shouldn't be dried out either.
Turn your oven on to high-broil
Shred the meat.  It should pull apart easily with a couple of forks.
Spread it out as thinly as possible on a baking sheet (I line it with foil)
Broil it for 10 min or so, some of it should be brown and crispy, but not burned.
