 I use my dutch oven to make this as it is quite a large amount of soup (almost like a stew)

  Ground beef (1 lb is enough)
   Sm. amt. oil for browning meat
  garlic
  1 cup carrots sliced
  1. onion  chopped            [You can also use frozen mixed veg. ]
  1 cup celery chopped
  2 cans beef broth
  1 large can tomatoes (I prefer the chopped ones)
   1/2 tsp thyme
  parsley

  Recipe calls for 3c. egg noodles, but I never use them.  You could add some lentils instead.

I brown the hamburger, and then dump everything else into the pot and let it simmer for however long it takes the veg to cook.  It's quite tasty and filling. I think you could add in whatever veg you like.
