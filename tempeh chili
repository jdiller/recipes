Tempeh Chili
4 Servings
This is a high-protein chili with the benefits of soy. If you haven't tried tempeh (a fermented cake of soybeans and whole grains) it's a great substitute for ground meat. You can substitute any canned beans for the kidney beans.

Ingredients:
2 tsp quality extra-virgin olive oil
1 onion, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 8 oz cake of tempeh, crumbled
1 can organic crushed tomatoes
1 can kidney beans, drained and rinsed
1 green pepper, diced
1 red pepper, diced
2 jalapeño peppers, seeded and diced
1/2 cup cilantro (fresh), chopped
1 tbsp cumin, ground
1 tsp salt
1 small can chipotle chili en adobo (optional)

Instructions:
Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan. Add the chopped onion, red and green peppers, jalapeños and the crumbled tempeh and stir fry for five to six minutes. Stir in the cumin and salt. Add the canned tomatoes, kidney beans, chopped cilantro and chipotle pepper (if you're using it). Allow the mixture to simmer for about 40 minutes. Sprinkle with low-fat cheddar cheese if you like.
