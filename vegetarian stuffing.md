Ingredients
- 2 sticks salted butter
- 3 tablespoons fresh, chopped sage
- 1 large, white onion, chopped
- 1 carrot, finely chopped
- 3 stalks celery finely chopped
- 2 apples, chopped (with skins)
- 3 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 can vegetable broth
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 loaf day-old french bread
- 1/2 cup Craisins or dried cranberries
- salt
- pepper

*Preparation*
Preheat oven to 350ºF. 
Melt butter in a large saute pan over medium heat. 
When the butter is melted add one tablespoon of the sage, the onion, celery and the carrot. 
When the onions become translucent, add the garlic, apples and salt and pepper generously, very generously.
After the apples have cooked for about 2 minutes, pour the vegetable broth into the pan, season with the cayenne and more salt and pepper as needed, and let the mixture saute for 1 to 2 more minutes. 
Tear the bread into approximately 1/2-inch squares and place in a 2-3/4-quart casserole dish.
Add the cranberries and sage.
Remove the mixture from the stove and pour it over the bread.
Mix well and bake uncovered at 350ºF for about 45 minutes to an hour. For best results, stir at least once.
